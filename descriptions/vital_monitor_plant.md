One of the first ways to make use of your arduino skills in real world is to make a simple yet useful plant/hydroponics monitor. 

Tools/Sensors/Boards Required : 
1. Arduino UNO
2. pH Sensor (only if using for hydroponics application)
3. DHT22 Humidity and Temperature Sensor
4. LDR Sensor
5. Relay Modules (as many needed for you)

Description of your Project:
1. The project uses simple code but will help you a create a project that is a great for beginners who are familiar with basic syntax.
2. The code is simple, all you have to do is read the Digital and Analog values from the sensors, write conditionals (if, then & else) to the relays with HIGH and LOW.
3. Then print the values and if you are comfortable use the Arduino IoT Cloud to manage this data with a wireless dashboard on your devices.

Benefits of this project (what you will learn):
1. This project would help you learn and understand more about reading Digital and Analog values from sensors and writing HIGH/LOW values to relays.
2. It will also give you insight into the next level of your Arduino Experience and introduce you to the Cloud framework.
