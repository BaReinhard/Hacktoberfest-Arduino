This project will help you start your experience with the Arduino IoT cloud. If you are a beginner and would like to start with the IoT cloud platform. 
This will help you understand more about this platform. This project requires only a Nano 33 IoT and a DHT22 to make.

The project is quite simple. It will store the data (humidity & temperature data) under the variables and the IoT Dashboard will display the data and even gaph the data!


The properties are to be set as followed:

1. Humidity - 
Name: Humidity
Variable: humidity
Permission: Read only
Update: every 3 seconds


1. Temperature - 
Name: Temperature
Variable: temperature
Permission: Read only
Update: every 3 seconds


If you would like to see the graph of the data, add a graph (or chart) and link it to th erespective variables.
